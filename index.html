  Once there was a tree...

  <!--Page 2-->
  <br>and she loved a little boy.

  </div>

  <div class = "young-boy">

    <div class= "flex-container">

    <div class = "flex-one">

  And every day
  <br>the boy
  <br>would come

  <!--Page 4-->
  <br>and he would
  <br>gather her leaves

  <!--Page 5-->
  <br>And make them into crowns
  <br>and play king of the forest
  </div>

  <div class = "young-boy-eat">
  <!--Page 6-->
  He would climb up her trunk

  <!--Page 7-->
  <br>and swing from her branches

  <!--Page 8-->
  <br>and eat apples.
  </div>

  <div class = "young-boy-play">
  <!--Page 9-->
  And they would play
  <br>hide and go seek

  <!--Page 10-->
  <br>And when he was tired,
  <br>he would sleep
  <br>in her shade.

  </div>

  <div class = "young-boy-end">

  <!--Page 11-->
  And the boy loved the tree...

  <!--Page 12-->
  <br>very much
  <br>And the tree was happy.

  </div>

  <div class = "young-boy-grows">
  <!--Page 13-->
  But time went by.

  <!--Page 14-->
  And the boy grew older.

  <!--Page 15-->
  And the tree was often alone.
  </div>

  <div class = "apple-sales">
  <!--Page 16-->
  Then one day the boy
  came to the tree
  and the tree said:

  <div class= "flex-container">

  <div class = "flex-one">
    <img src="./assets/tree.jpg">
  </div>

  <div class = "page-16-tree flex-two">
  "Come, Boy, come and
  climb up my trunk
  and swing from
  my branches
  and eat apples and
  play in my shade
  and be happy."
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class= "flex-container">

  <div class = "page-17-boy flex-two">
  <!--Page 17-->
  "I am too big to
  climb and play,"
  said the boy.
  "I want to buy things
  and have fun.
  I want some money.
  Can you give me
  some money?"
  </div>

  <div class="flex-one">
    <img src="./assets/boy.png">
  </div>
  </div>

  <!--Page 18-->
  <div class= "flex-container">

  <div class = "flex-one">
    <img src="./assets/tree.jpg">
  </div>

  <div class = "page-16-tree flex-two">
  "I'm sorry,"
  said the tree,
  "but I have no money.
  I have only leaves
  and apples.
  Take my apples, Boy,
  and sell them in the city.
  Then you will
  have money
  and you will be happy."
  </div>
  </div>

  <!--Page 19-->
  And so the boy climbed up the tree
  and gathered her apples
  and carried them away.

  And the tree was happy...
  </div>

  </div>
  <!--Page 20-->
  But the boy stayed away for a long time...
  and the tree was sad.
  </div>

  <div>
  And then one day
  the boy came back
  and the tree shook
  with joy and she said,
  "Come, Boy, climb up
  my trunk and swing
  from my branches
  and be happy."
  </div>

  <!--Page 21-->
  "I am too busy to climb trees,"
  said the boy.
  "I want a house to keep me warm,"
  he said.
  "I want a wife and I want children,
  and so I need a house.
  Can you give me a house?"

  <!--Page 22-->
  "I have no house," said the tree.
  "The forest is my house,
  but you may cut off my branches
  and build a house.
  Then you will be happy."

  <!--Page 23-->
  And so the boy cut off her branches
  and carried them away to build his house.

  <!--Page 24-->
  And the tree was happy...

  <!--Page 25-->
  But the boy stayed away
  for a long time.
  And when he came back,
  the tree was so happy
  she could hardly speak.
  "Come, Boy," she whispered,
  "come and play."
  "I am too old and sad to play,"
  said the boy.
  "I want a boat that will
  take me far away from here.
  Can you give me a boat?"
  "Cut down my trunk and make
  a boat," said the tree.
  "Then you can sail away...
  and be happy."

  <!--Page 26-->
  And so the boy cut down her trunk

  and made a boat and sailed away.

 <div class="page-27" align="center">
   <img src="./assets/treestump.svg" width ="400">
  <!--Page 27-->
  <br>And the tree was happy... but not really
</div>


 <div class="page-28">
  <!--Page 28-->
  And after a long time
  the boy came back again.

  <div class="dialogue-left" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "I am sorry, Boy," said the tree,
    <br>"but I have nothing left to give you,
    <br>my apples are gone."
  </div>
  <div class="dialogue-right" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "My teeth are too weak for apples,"
    <br>said the boy.
  </div>
  <div class="dialogue-left" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "My branches are gone," said the tree.
    <br>"You cannot swing on them."
  </div>
  <div class="dialogue-right" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "I am too old to swing on branches,"
    <br>said the boy.
  </div>
  <div class="dialogue-left" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "My trunk is gone," said the tree.
    <br>"You cannot climb."
  </div>
  <div class="dialogue-right" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "I am too tired to climb,"
    <br>said the boy.
  </div>
</div>

 <div class="page-29" align ="center">
<!--Page 29-->
  "I am sorry," sighed the tree.
</div>
<div>
  <br>"I wish that I could give you something...
  <br>But I have nothing left.
  <br>I am just an old stump.
</div>

<div class="page-29b" align ="center">
  I am sorry..."
</div>

  "I don't need very much now,"
  said the boy,
  "just a quiet place to sit and rest.
  I am very tired."

  "Well," said the tree,
  straightening herself up
  as far as she could,
  "well, an old stump is good
  for sitting and resting.
  Come, Boy, sit down.
  sit down and rest."

  And the boy did.

  <!--Page 30-->
  And the tree was happy...
