    Once there was a tree...

    <br>and she loved a little boy.

        And every day the boy would come
        <br>and he would gather her leaves
        <!--Page 5-->

        <br>and play king of the forest

  <div class = "young-boy-play">

    And they would play
    <br>hide and go seek

    <!--Page 10-->
    <br>And when he was tired,
    <br>he would sleep
    <br>in her shade.

  <div class = "young-boy-end">

    <!--Page 11-->
    And the boy loved the tree...

    <!--Page 12-->
    <br>very much
    <br>And the tree was happy.

    But time went by,
    <!--Page 14-->
    And the boy grew older.
    <!--Page 15-->
    <br>And the tree was often alone.

    <!--Page 16-->
    <br>Then one day the boy
    came to the tree
    <br>and the tree said:
    <br>
    <br><i>"Come, Boy, come and climb up my trunk
      <br>and swing from my branches
      <br>and eat apples and play in my shade
      <br>and be happy."</i>

        "I am too big to
        climb and play,"
        <br>said the boy.
        "I want to buy things
        and have fun.
        <br>I want some money.
        <br>Can you give me
        some money?"
      </div>

        "I'm sorry,"
        <br>said the tree,
      <br>"but I have no money.
        I have only leaves
        and apples.
        Take my apples, Boy,
        and sell them in the city.
        Then you will
        have money
        and you will be happy."
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--Page 19-->
    And so the boy climbed up the tree
    and gathered her apples
    and carried them away.

    And the tree was happy...
  </div>

</div>
<!--Page 20-->
But the boy stayed away for a long time...
and the tree was sad.
</div>

<div>
  And then one day
  the boy came back
  and the tree shook
  with joy and she said,
  "Come, Boy, climb up
  my trunk and swing
  from my branches
  and be happy."
</div>

<!--Page 21-->
"I am too busy to climb trees,"
said the boy.
"I want a house to keep me warm,"
he said.
"I want a wife and I want children,
and so I need a house.
Can you give me a house?"

<!--Page 22-->
"I have no house," said the tree.
"The forest is my house,
but you may cut off my branches
and build a house.
Then you will be happy."

<!--Page 23-->
And so the boy cut off her branches
and carried them away to build his house.

<!--Page 24-->
And the tree was happy...

<!--Page 25-->
But the boy stayed away
for a long time.
And when he came back,
the tree was so happy
she could hardly speak.
"Come, Boy," she whispered,
"come and play."
"I am too old and sad to play,"
said the boy.
"I want a boat that will
take me far away from here.
Can you give me a boat?"
"Cut down my trunk and make
a boat," said the tree.
"Then you can sail away...
and be happy."

<!--Page 26-->
And so the boy cut down her trunk

and made a boat and sailed away.

  <!--Page 28-->
  And after a long time
  the boy came back again.

  <div align="left" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "I am sorry, Boy," said the tree,
    <br>"but I have nothing left to give you,

  <div align="right" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">

  <!--Page 29-->
  "I am sorry," sighed the tree.
</div>
<div>
  <br>"I wish that I could give you something...
  <br>But I have nothing left.
  <br>I am just an old stump.
</div>

<div class="page-29b" align ="center">
  I am sorry..."

"I don't need very much now,"
said the boy,
"just a quiet place to sit and rest.
I am very tired."

"Well," said the tree,
straightening herself up
as far as she could,
"well, an old stump is good
for sitting and resting.
Come, Boy, sit down.
sit down and rest."

And the boy did.

And the tree was happy...
