    Once there was a tree...

    <br>and she loved a little boy.

        And every day the boy would come
        <br>and he would gather her leaves
        <!--Page 5-->
        <br>And make them into crowns and play king of the forest.

        <br>He would climb up her trunk

        <!--Page 7-->
        <br>and swing from her branches

        <!--Page 8-->
        <br>and eat apples.

    And they would play hide and go seek
    <!--Page 10-->
    <br>And when he was tired, he would sleep in her shade.
    <!--Page 11-->
    <br>And the boy loved the tree very much.
    <!--Page 12-->
    <br>And the tree was happy.

    But time went by,
    <!--Page 14-->
    And the boy grew older.
    <!--Page 15-->
    <br>And the tree was often alone.
</div>
<div>
  <!--Page 16-->
    <br>Then one day the boy
    came to the tree
    <br>and the tree said:
<div class="tree">
    <br><i>"Come, Boy, come and climb up my trunk
      <br>and swing from my branches
      <br>and eat apples and play in my shade

        <!--Page 17-->
        "I am too big to climb and play," said the boy.
        <br>"I want to buy things and have fun.
        <br>I want some money.
        <br>Can you give me some money?"
      </div>

      <div class="flex-one">
        <img src="./assets/boy.png">

    </div>

    <!--Page 18-->
    <div class= "flex-container">

      </div>

      <div class = "page-16-tree flex-two tree">
        "I'm sorry," said the tree,
        <br>"but I have no money. I have only leaves and apples.
        <br>Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in the city.
        <br>Then you will have money and you will be happy."
      </div>
    </div>

<div>
    <!--Page 19-->
    And so the boy climbed up the tree
    <br>and gathered her apples
    <br>and carried them away.
<br>
    <br><i>And the tree was happy...</i>
  </div>

</div>
<!--Page 20-->
But the boy stayed away for a long time...
</div>
<div class="half-opacity">
  <i>and the tree was sad.</i>
</div>

<div>
  And then one day the boy came back,
  <br>and the tree shook with joy and she said,
</div>
<div>
  "Come, Boy, climb up my trunk
  <br>and swing from my branches
  <br><font color="green">and be happy."</font>
</div>
<img src="./assets/apple.svg" width="80%">
<div>
  <!--Page 21-->
  "I am too busy to climb trees,"said the boy.
  <br>"I want a house to keep me warm," he said.
  <br>"I want a wife and I want children, and so I need a house.
  <br>Can you give me a house?"
</div>
<!--Page 22-->
<div>
  "I have no house," said the tree.
  <br>"The forest is my house,
  <br>but you may cut off my branches and build a house.
  <br>Then you will be happy."
</div>
<!--Page 23-->
<div>
  And so the boy cut off her branches
  <br>and carried them away to build his house.
  <br><!--Page 24-->
  <br>And the tree was happy...
</div>
<div>
  <!--Page 25-->
  But the boy stayed away for a long time.
  <br>And when he came back, the tree was so happy she could hardly speak.
</div>

<div>
  "Come, Boy," she whispered,
  <br>"come and play."
</div>

<div>
  "I am too old and sad to play, said the boy.
  <br>"I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
  <br>Can you give me a boat?"
</div>

<div>
  "Cut down my trunk and make a boat," said the tree.
  <br>"Then you can sail away...
  <br>and be happy."
</div>

<div>
  <!--Page 26-->
  And so the boy cut down her trunk
  <br>and made a boat and sailed away.
</div>

<div class="page-27" align="center">
  <img src="./assets/treestump.svg" width ="400">
  <!--Page 27-->
  <br>And the tree was happy... but not really
</div>

</div></div></div></div></div>
<div class="page-28">
  <!--Page 28-->
  And after a long time
  the boy came back again.

  <div class="dialog-left tree" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "I am sorry, Boy," said the tree,
    <br>"but I have nothing left to give you,
    <br>my apples are gone."
  </div>

  <div class="dialog-right boy" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "My teeth are too weak for apples,"
    <br>said the boy.
  </div>

  <div class="dialog-left tree" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "My branches are gone," said the tree.
    <br>"You cannot swing on them."
  </div>

  <div class="dialog-right boy" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "I am too old to swing on branches,"
    <br>said the boy.
  </div>

  <div class="dialog-left tree" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "My trunk is gone," said the tree.
    <br>"You cannot climb."
  </div>

  <div class="dialog-right boy" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">
    "I am too tired to climb,"
    <br>said the boy.

</div>

<div class="page-29 tree" align ="center">
  <!--Page 29-->
  "I am sorry," sighed the tree.
</div>
<div class ="tree">
  <br>"I wish that I could give you something...
  <br>But I have nothing left.
  <br>I am just an old stump.
</div>

<div class="page-29b tree" align ="center">
  I am sorry..."
</div>

<div class="boy" align="left">
"I don't need very much now," said the boy,
<br>"just a quiet place to sit and rest.
<br>I am very tired."
</div>

<div class="tree" align="right">
"Well," said the tree,
<br>straightening herself up as far as she could,
<br>"well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting.
<br>Come, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest."
</div>

<div>
And the boy did.
